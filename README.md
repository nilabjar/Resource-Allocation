Resource-Allocation
===================

This repo contains a couple of projects which implement various kinds of Bin-Packing algorithms. 

The BP algos actually simulate resource allocation solutions and are multi-dimensional. 


The code implements the work done in the paper:

Schmidt, Toward Effective Multi-capacity Resource Allocation in Distributed Real-time and Embedded Systems, Proceedings of the 11th IEEE International Symposium on Object/Component/Service-oriented Real-time Distributed Computing, Orlando, Florida, May 5-7, 2008
